      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">Mission Statement</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Inspired by the enduring legacy of principled journalism, Chaincue Technologies AB is dedicated exclusively to
        tracking, reporting, and analyzing natural disasters around the globe. Our core values are embodied in the
        Seven Principles for the Conduct of Natural Disaster Journalism, displayed prominently in our Stockholm
        newsroom:
      </p>

      <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-4">
        <li>
          <p class="font-bold">Relentless Truth-Seeking</p>
          <p>
            We commit to uncovering and presenting facts about every disaster "as nearly as the truth may be
            ascertained," no matter how complex or remote.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="font-bold">Comprehensive Transparency</p>
          <p>
            From hurricanes to wildfires, tsunamis to seismic events, we strive to report "all the truth so far as we
            can learn it," ensuring no critical detail goes unexamined.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="font-bold">Human-Centered Decorum</p>
          <p>
            While conveying the scale of destruction, we honor the dignity and resilience of affected communities,
            producing content suitable for audiences of all ages.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="font-bold">Public-First Service</p>
          <p>
            Our allegiance is to those at risk and to society at large—not to private interests. We deliver
            life-saving alerts, preparedness guidance, and recovery resources free from outside influence.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="font-bold">Sacrifice for the Common Good</p>
          <p>
            If upholding these truths demands financial, logistical, or editorial sacrifices, we accept them willingly
            in service of global safety and well-being.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="font-bold">Impartial Independence</p>
          <p>
            Free from political or corporate alliances, our coverage remains fair, balanced, and wholly devoted to the
            public interest.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="font-bold">Forward-Looking Resilience</p>
          <p>
            Beyond reporting—what was—we illuminate strategies for what comes next: adaptation, mitigation, and
            community resilience in a changing climate.

          <p>
            Chaincue Technologies AB was established in Uppsala by a coalition of disaster- response veterans and data
            scientists who recognized the need for a dedicated global disaster intelligence platform.
